# bash settings

## setup

- Run `make bash` from repo root
- Follow the steps in the Makefile to manually

## customization

You can add any personal/computer specific settings to a file called `local_settings` and it will
be automatically loaded with the rest of the files. It will also be loaded last so will take
priority over everything else.
